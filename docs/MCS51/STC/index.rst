Cloud & Desktop IDE
===================

Native Extensions
-----------------

Native extensions and plugins provide official MCS51 with IDEs/Text Editors and
contain built-in :ref:`piocore` and :ref:`piohome`. We **highly recommend** to use the
next native integrations for:

* :ref:`ide_vscode`
* :ref:`ide_clion` (Experimental)

.. note::
    In our experience, :ref:`ide_vscode` offers better system performance, and users
    have found it easier to get started
