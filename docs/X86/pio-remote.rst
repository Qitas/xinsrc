|PIORemote| allows you to work remotely with devices from
*Anywhere In The World*. No matter where are you now! Run a small and
cross-platform :ref:`arm` on a remote machine and you are able to
list active devices (wireless + wired), to upload firmware (program),
to process remote unit tests, or to start remote debugging session via
**Remote Serial Port Monitor**.

Using |PIORemote| you can share your devices with colleagues across your
organization or friends. In combination with :ref:`stm32`, you can create
awesome things at any time when inspiration comes to you.

You should have :ref:`stm32` to use |PIORemote|.
A registration is **FREE**.
