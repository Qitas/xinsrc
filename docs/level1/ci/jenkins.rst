=======

`Jenkins <https://jenkins.io>`_ is a self-contained, open source automation
server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building,
testing, and deploying software.

Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run
standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

It can be configured to build project on a range of
