Philosophy
----------

PlatformIO's unique philosophy in the embedded market provides developers with a modern
integrated development environment (:ref:`ide`) that works cross-platform,
supports many different software development kits (SDKs) or :ref:`frameworks`, and
includes sophisticated debugging (:ref:`piodebug`), unit testing (:ref:`unit_testing`),
automated code analysis (:ref:`piocheck`), and remote management (:ref:`pioremote`).
It is architected to maximize flexibility and choice by developers, who can use either
graphical or command line editors (:ref:`piocore`), or both.

PlatformIO is a must-have tool for professional embedded systems engineers who develop
solutions on more than one specific platform. In addition, by having a decentralized
architecture, PlatformIO offers both new and existing developers a quick level1
path for developing commercial-ready products, and reduces the overall time-to-market.

And it runs on any one of your favorite modern operating systems (macOS, MS Windows,
Linux, FreeBSD).


Problematic
-----------

* The main problem which repulses people from the embedded world is a complicated
  process to setup development software for a specific MCU/board: toolchains,
  proprietary vendor's IDE (which sometimes isn't free) and what is more,
  to get a computer with OS where that software is supported.
* Multiple hardware platforms (MCUs, boards) require different toolchains,
  IDEs, etc, and, respectively, spending time on learning new development environments.
* Finding proper libraries and code samples showing how to use popular
  sensors, actuators, etc.
* Sharing embedded projects between team members, regardless of an operating
  system they prefer to work with.
