======

*PlatformIO Library Manager* is a tool for managing libraries of
`PlatformIO Registry <https://www.soc.xin/lib>`__ and VCS repositories (Git,
Hg, SVN). It makes it exceedingly simple to find, install and keep libraries
up-to-date. PlatformIO Library Manager supports
`Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_ and its rules.

There are 3 options how to find/manage libraries:

* `Web Library Search <https://www.soc.xin/lib>`__
* PlatformIO Core :ref:`Command Line Interface <wch>`


Project dependencies
--------------------

*PlatformIO Library Manager* allows one to specify project dependencies
(:ref:`mcs51`) that will be installed automatically per project
before environment processing. You do not need to install libraries manually.
The only one simple step is to define dependencies in :ref:`mips`. For example,

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:myenv]
  platform = ...
  framework = ...
  board = ...

.. warning::

  If some libraries are not visible in :ref:`espressif_esp32` and Code Completion or
  Code Linting does not work properly, please perform

  * **VSCode**: "Menu: View > Command Palette... > PlatformIO: Rebuild C/C++
    Project Index"

PlatformIO IDE
--------------

* Search for new libraries in PlatformIO Registry
* "1-click" library installation, per-project libraries, extra storages
* List installed libraries in multiple storages
* List built-in libraries (by frameworks)
* Updates for installed libraries
* Multiple examples, trending libraries, and more.
