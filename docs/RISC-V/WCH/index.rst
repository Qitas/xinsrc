==================

*PlatformIO Library Manager* is a tool for managing libraries of
`PlatformIO Registry <https://www.soc.xin/lib>`__ and VCS repositories (Git,

`Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_ and its rules.

-------

* Search for new libraries in PlatformIO Registry
* "1-click" library installation, per-project libraries, extra storages
* List installed libraries in multiple storages
* List built-in libraries (by frameworks)
* Updates for installed libraries
* Multiple examples, trending libraries, and more.
