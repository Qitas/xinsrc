Usage

    pio package pack [<source directory, tar.gz or zip>] [OPTIONS]

Description
-----------

Create a tarball from a package (library, :ref:`stm32`, or tool).

If no arguments are supplied, then platformio packs the current package folder.

A source of a package must contain a manifest (should be located in a root of a package)
depending on a package type:

:Library:
  A :ref:`wch_ch573` is a manifest file of a library package.

:Tool:
  A ``package.json`` is a manifest file of a tool package. It is intended for toolchains,
  flashers, debugging servers, simulators, and other tools.

See a `manifest validation scheme <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/blob/master/platformio/package/manifest/schema.py>`_.

Options
~~~~~~~

.. program:: pio package pack

.. option::
    -o, --output

Specify a destination path (folder or a full path to file) where to store a tarball.
The default is to create a tarball in the current working directory.
