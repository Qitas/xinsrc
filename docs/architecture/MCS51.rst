MCS51
===============

``BSD``

`MCS-51 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8051>`_ is a single chip microcontroller (MCU) series developed by Intel in 1980 for use in embedded systems.
The architect of the instruction set of the Intel MCS-51 was John H.

Wharton.[1][2] Intel's original versions were popular in the 1980s and early 1990s and enhanced binary compatible derivatives remain popular today.
It is an example of a complex instruction set computer, and has separate memory spaces for program instructions and data.
